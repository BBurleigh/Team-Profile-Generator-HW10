# Team-Profile-Generator-HW10

## Description
Aside from this being a HW assignment, the goal was to practice temperate literal writing, document generation using Node.js, as well creating classes that we could test for errors. The user, who is a manager, can input information about themselves as well as their teammates. In turn, an HTML file would be created with that information.

## Installation
There is no installation required for this to run.

## Usage
This video linked into the README.md serves as a demo for how to use the app and what is generated from it.

## Contributions
Aside from myself and research, my tutor and a number of support staff at AskBCS Learning (on Slack) immensely helped me by bouncing ideas off of each other and finding areas where the code could be fixed/tweaked/added/removed.
